# [<center>Cohort 18 Hack Sprint - 1624</center>](https://intranet.hbtn.io/projects/1624)

 ### <center>Description</center>
 ##### &emsp; We were tasked with using the skills that we have learned to create a new product based on a topic chosen by our educators. The chosen topic was "bubbles." Many groups leaned into a game, as we nearly did, but we finally decided on a magic 8-ball, born again with fins and gils and a worse attitude. This is Sirena.

 ##### &emsp; To use Sirena, simply navigate to [the GitHub page](https://conkobar.github.io/see-horse/) and follow the directions on-screen! Good fortunes to you, friend.
